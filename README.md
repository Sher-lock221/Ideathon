Contains Idea for elevating StackUp platform

Some of the features that can elevate the StackUp platform are as follows:

1. **Achievements**: Badges and certificates can be added to give the users a sense of achievement.
   
2. **Gamification Elements**: Simple games can be added to make certain programming languages more interactive to learn and implement them.

3. **Profile Level**: Based upon the number of quests completed and use of learning materials, users can gain experience points, which increases their profile level. Also, profile level 1-10 can be marked as Beginner, 10-15 as Novice, ... and so on to further increase the competitive spirit of users.

4. **1 on 1 sessions**: A method can be developed where users (who meet certain criteria) can get the opportunity to talk directly with the CM or relevant people regarding coding and community growth. The conversation record can be saved for a month after which it will get deleted automatically. This gives ample time to new users as well as old users to understand StackUp.

5. **Welcoming New Users**: A certain system can be developed where the developers or the CM get a notification that at least 20-50 new users have joined StackUp in a month. The StackUp website's joining page (or the relevant page) can  encourage them to join the Discord server through an interactive ad-like element. A member of the Discord family of StackUp can be asked for a QnA session regarding StackUp in a new thread. Although this point falls under Discord, the main focus was to encourage them to join the Discord server by adding catchy, interactive elements on the StackUp platform.

6. **Coding Challenges**: Every week, regarding a certain language, a coding challenge can be conducted on the website to test the skills and knowledge of Stackies regarding that language. One question, every week for 3 types of difficulty: Easy, Medium and Hard can be done.

7. **Rewards**: The winners from the coding challenges can be awarded Stackcoins to redeem items like profile icon styles, cool background images of the website which users can set on their own accounts. Also, they can use these Stackoins to buy cool designs of their profile page which other users can see when they visit their fellow Stackies' profiles. The higher the difficulty, the more Stackoins they can earn.

8. **StackUp app**: An Android or iOS application can be developed to make it easier for Stackies to track their progress, balance and relevant information only connected to their accounts.

9. **Project Showcase**: A page can be created where Stackies showcase their projects. Also, a "Youtube comments" like area can be created where Stackies leave valuable suggestions to improve fellow Stackies' projects.

10. **Tech News**: If possible, a page where Stackies can read a small piece of news or article regarding technology can be developed, which contains only 3 hypertext links with a small thumbnail, which needs to be updated once a week only.
